      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I grew up in Chicago and recently moved to the suburbs of Nashville with my family. I am currently a student at Valparaiso University in Indiana. As a sophmore in the computer engineering I am planning to graduate in 2021 with a bachelors degree. Here at school I am looking to get involved here more but am waiting a semester to get settled in before I join any clubs or extra curriculars. The robotics club and intramural sports look like the best options for me. To get to this point I have attented Purdue University, Harper College and Nashville State Community College. It's been a crazy couple of years but I finally like where I'm at.<br><br><br>I am looking for an engineering job or paid internship close to Chicago, Nashville, or Valparaiso. <br><br><br>My goals so far are to graduate from college (preferably with a job lined up) and to work in the computer hardware or aerospace industries.</p>
